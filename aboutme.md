# About this Channel  
This channel's purpose is for students to reach out with questions, as well as for me to give notices, updates, or occasional tips. To facilitate these purposes, I have some asks:  
  
### __One: Threads__ 🧵  
  
As this channel is primarily for inquiries and help, please **send a single message** in this channel, then **create a thread for that message**. This keeps the channel organized, and the threads make ⭐ ***__searching__*** ⭐ for a question someone else has asked much quicker. Got an infodump? Want an infodump? That's what the **threads** are for.  
If you find a thread with your question but *not* your answer, please add to that thread instead of making a new one.  
  
🧶 *To create a Thread, right-click or tap and hold a message, then select **Create Thread.***
🔎 *To search for a Thread, use `Ctrl` + `F`, or find the search box and prepend your search with `in:{yourname}-chat`.*
  
### __Two: Stay On-Topic__ 📝  
This channel is for you to ask me--**as a teaching assistant**--questions about class content, computer science discussions, or other teaching assistance. If you have a topic that would better serve a wider audience, **please use <#1275746736392110154> for general topics**, or the <#1275749260440240138> / <#1275749280979750922> channels for broader topics related to those classes.  
  
💬 *I am happy to discuss many tech topics with you; simply consider your audience.*  
  
### __Three: Privacy__ 🔏  
> Consider editing this based on your use of Discord.  
This is my public Discord account, for use with school and work. That being said, please understand that I wish to keep my private life private. My DM's are open, but @'ing me here will be the fastest way to reach me.  
  
### __Four: Be polite, or at least be human.__ 🧡  
Follow Discord TOS, treat people with respect, and be your authentic self. ✨

> Read through this document and edit as needed. This is meant as a guideline to help create Discord copy faster.
