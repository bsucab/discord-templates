# discord-templates
Templates for TAs to advertise office hours and other info on Discord.

Character limit is 2000 without paying ofr nitro. Split into multiple messages if required. Check [here](https://wordcounttools.com/) for character count.

I use [Vencord web](https://vencord.dev/download/) through [Violentmonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey) on Firefox with the "copy raw" plugin to copy these templates quickly.
> _Please note: _ Using custom clients is technically against Discord's terms, but they selectively enforce it and only target people logging messages client side or abuse the API and paid features usually.

Some markdown looks weird on github but looks fine on discord. As long as you don't ping anyone, feel free to try your message first in staff-commands or any other bot/spam channel (or use the "Preview message" plugin in vencord).
